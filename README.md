# NLP_Bootcamp_HW
I’m excited to share my latest project: “NLP Pipeline for IMDB Movie Reviews Classification”! 
Over the past weeks at Mindset Institute Data Science Bootcamp, I built an end‑to‑end workflow that:
Cleans and preprocesses raw reviews with BeautifulSoup, regex, and NLTK
Extracts features via Bag‑of‑Words and TF–IDF
Trains and evaluates both Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers
Includes an interactive demo for live sentiment predictions
